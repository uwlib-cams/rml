# Installing RML Mapper

## Install maven

 - Run the following commands  
`$ sudo apt update`  
`$ sudo apt install maven`

 - Confirm that the installation worked by asking for the version number  
`$ mvn -v`

## Clone the [RML Mapper GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java)  
`$ git clone https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java.git`

## Install using maven

 - Navigate to the directory that contains pom.xml  
`$ cd rmlmapper-java`

  - Run the following command:  
`$ mvn install`

_Note: the install seems to trip up while running the CSV tests. It may skip them (which is fine, unless youâ€™re transforming CSV data), or the install may fail. If the install fails, instead of `mvn install`, run the following command instead:_  
`$ mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`

 - Locate the jar file  
`$ cd target`

 - The directory should contain the following files:  
    - `original-rmlmapper-4.7.0-r152.jar`
    - `rmlmapper-4.7.0-r152.jar`  
_The numbers with these files may be different with future versions of RML Mapper._  

 - Try both to see which one works on your computer. (For mcm104, one would only work on WSL, while the other worked for Mac.)
 - Confirm the installation of RML Mapper worked by asking for the help menu  
`$ java -jar rmlmapper-4.7.0-r152.jar -h`

# Running RML Mapper

`java -jar rmlmapper-4.7.0-r152.jar -m RML_demo_map.ttl -s turtle`
_Name of jar file may be different on your computer_

# RML property cheat sheet
- All triples maps need to be classed as rr:TriplesMap
- All triples need ONE logical source, ONE subject map, and one or more predicate object maps

Properties in logical sources:
- [rml:source](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/rml#sourceName)
	- filepath to data for conversion
- [rml:referenceFormulation](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/rml#referenceFormulation)
	- ql:XPath, ql:JSONPath, or ql:CSV
- [rml:iterator](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/rml#iterator)
	- parent properties (default for our purposes is "RDF/Description")

Properties in subject map:
- When the subject is a resource...
	- [rml:reference](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/rml#reference)
		- For when the value exists somewhere in the data for conversion
	- [rr:constant](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#constant)
		- For constant values that are the same every time
- When the subject is a blank node...
	- [rr:termType](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#termType)
	  - [rr:BlankNode](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#BlankNode)
- [rr:class](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#class)

Properties in predicate object map:
- [rr:predicate](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#predicate)
- [rr:objectMap](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#objectMap)

Properties in object map:
- When the object is an IRI or literal...
	- [rml:reference](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/rml#reference)
		- For when the value exists somewhere in the data for conversion
	- [rr:constant](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#constant)
		- For constant values that are the same every time
- When the object is a blank node...
	- [rr:parentTriplesMap](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#parentTriplesMap)
- rr:termType
	- [rr:Literal](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#Literal) (optional; this is the default)
	- [rr:IRI](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#IRI)
	- [rr:BlankNode](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#BlankNode)
- For literals with language tags...
	- [rr:language](http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#language)
		- use for constant language tag (e.g. if it will ALWAYS be English, use "en")
	- [rml:languageMap](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/rml#languageMap)
		- use when the language tag depends on the data for conversion

Properties in language map:
- [rml:reference](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/rml#reference)
	- For when the value exists somewhere in the data for conversion

# Troubleshooting

 - Most error messages in the mapper are not very descriptive, so pay close attention to your mapping!
 - When changing the value for `rml:source` (i.e. the location of your source data), make sure you change it in _every_ triples map in your mapping file!
 - If you have reorganized your files, make sure your mapping is updated so the `rml:source` reflects the new file paths!
 - Sometimes RML gets tripped up on file permissions for the source data or for the mapping document. This can be fixed using `chmod`, e.g.  
`$ chmod u+rwx RML_demo_data.xml`

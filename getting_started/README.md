# Installing RML Mapper

## Install maven

 - Run the following commands  
`$ sudo apt update`
`$ sudo apt install maven`

 - Confirm that the installation worked by asking for the version number  
`$ mvn -v`

## Clone the [RML Mapper GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java)  
`$ git clone https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java.git`

## Install using maven

 - Navigate to the directory that contains pom.xml  
`$ cd rmlmapper-java`

  - Run the following command:  
`$ mvn install`

_Note: the install seems to trip up while running the CSV tests. It may skip them (which is fine, unless youâ€™re transforming CSV data), or the install may fail. If the install fails, instead of `mvn install`, run the following command instead:_  
`$ mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`

 - Locate the jar file  
`$ cd target`

 - The directory should contain the following files:  
    - `original-rmlmapper-4.7.0-r152.jar`
    - `rmlmapper-4.7.0-r152.jar`  
_The numbers with this file may be different with future versions of RML Mapper._  

 - The correct jar file is the latter (`rmlmapper-4.7.0-r152.jar`)
 - Confirm the installation of RML Mapper worked by asking for the help menu  
`$ java -jar rmlmapper-4.7.0-r152.jar -h`

# Running RML Mapper

`java -jar rmlmapper-4.7.0-r152.jar -m RML_demo_map.ttl -s turtle`

# Troubleshooting

 - Most error messages in the mapper are not very descriptive, so pay close attention to your mapping!
 - When changing the value for `rml:source` (i.e. the location of your source data), make sure you change it in _every_ triples map in your mapping file!
 - If you have reorganized your files, make sure your mapping is updated so the `rml:source` reflects the new file paths!
 - Sometimes RML gets tripped up on file permissions for the source data or for the mapping document. This can be fixed using `chmod`, e.g.  
`$ chmod u+rwx RML_demo_data.xml`

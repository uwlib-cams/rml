            rdfs:label "\"Arrested in 1849 for belonging to a secret group of radical utopians, Fyodor Dostoevsky was sentenced to four years in a Siberian labor camp--a terrible mental, spiritual, and physical ordeal that inspired him to write the novel 'The house of the dead'. Told from the point of view of a fictitious narrator--a convict serving a ten-year sentence for murdering his wife--'The house of the dead' describes in vivid detail the horrors that Dostoevsky himself witnessed while in prison: the brutality of guards who relish cruelty for its own sake; the evil of criminals who enjoy murdering children; and the existence of decent souls amid filth and degradation. Also included in this volume is Dostoevsky's first published work, 'Poor folk', a novel written in the form of letters that brought him immediate critical and public recognition\"--Page 4 of cover."@eng ] ;

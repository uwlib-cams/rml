_:2 a bf:Summary;
  rdfs:label "\"The Lorax is a children's book written by Dr. Seuss and first published in 1971.[1] It chronicles the plight of the environment and the Lorax is the titular character, who \"speaks for the trees\" and confronts the Once-ler, who causes environmental destruction. As in most Dr. Seuss books, the creatures mentioned are typically unique to the story.  The story is commonly recognized as a fable concerning the danger that corporate greed poses to nature,[not verified in body] using the literary element of personification to create relateable characters for industry (as the Once-ler), the environment (the Truffula trees) and activism (as the Lorax).  It was Dr. Seuss's personal favorite of his books. He was able to create a story addressing industrial/economic and environmental issues without it being dull: \"The Lorax came out of me being angry. In The Lorax I was out to attack what I think are evil things and let the chips fall where they might.\"[2] \"--Wikipedia, November 13, 2019."@en .

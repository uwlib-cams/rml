Inappropriate obedience training methods can often produce a stubborn and unwilling learner. This book, a title in Barron's Training Your Dog series, presents breed-specific advice to dog owners. The emphasis is on dog-friendly methods for teaching skills and preventing or correcting bad habits. Virtually every aspect of canine training is covered, including house training, teaching obedience to verbal cues and hand signals, retrieving, walking the dog on a leash, and more. Instructive color photos appear on most pages\"-- Provided by publisher."@eng ] ;

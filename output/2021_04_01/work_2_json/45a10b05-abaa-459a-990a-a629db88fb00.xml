We explored associations between parents' HL and barriers to participation and clinical outcomes. Study design: We conducted a prospective cohort study using secondary survey and administrative data at a large pediatric hospital from 10/2014 through 12/2015. Parents of children admitted to a medical or surgical service who completed a two-phase survey were included. We used linear and logistic regression to estimate associations between low HL and patient outcomes (length of stay, unplanned readmission) and five parent-reported barriers, adjusting for confounders. Results: Of eligible families, 10.7% (391) had low HL. Children of parents with low HL stayed in the hospital 0.18 days longer than children of parents with adequate HL (95% CI=0.027-0.310) but were not more likely to experience unplanned readmission (OR=0.95; 95% CI=0.61-1.49). Parents with low HL had higher odds of cultural distance with their child's provider (OR=1.38; 95% CI=1.03-1.84). We found a possible association between low HL and system barriers (OR=1.33; 95% CI=0.95-1.86), physician distrust (OR=1.46; 95% CI=0.92-2.33), and better partnership (OR=0.65; 95% CI=0.40-1.06), though the magnitude remains uncertain. Low HL was not associated with distrust in the healthcare system after adjusting for covariates (OR=0.91; 95% CI=0.66-1.27). Conclusions: HL was associated with longer length of stay and several parent-reported barriers to care. Strategies that better engage low-HL families could increase involvement in shared decision-making by reducing cultural distance, system barriers, and distrust, and might thereby reduce length of stay. However, HL is not the only (or most important) barrier families face."}]}, {"@id": "_:N1331f796f9bd4a858659c1341a70c9ff", "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs": [{"@id": "http://rdaregistry.info/termList/RDAContentType/1020"}]}, {"@id": "_:N18dce7ceb80e456bb8fcb02953ca03d8", "@type": ["http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/Script"], "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label": [{"@language": "eng", "@value": "Latin"}]}, {"@id": "_:Ne10c1bd4decd41b0912c82e239d1547a", "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs": [{"@id": "https://api.sinopia.io/resource/06241196-c494-427b-8fad-a06b974bbe20"}]}, {"@id": "_:Nc55777acf1724ca1b1648442e24453ce", "@type": ["http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/AdminMetadata"], "http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bflc/catalogerID": [{"@language": "eng", "@value": "lins@uw.edu"}], "http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bflc/encodingLevel": [{"@id": "_:Nb1af9b902ab54fd98fe3ae106cc3a9a7"}], "http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/creationDate": [{"@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date", "@value": "2020-05-01"}], "http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/descriptionConventions": [{"@id": "_:Ndf57dd936e8d4ff89d205139cf02e9d6"}], "http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/descriptionLanguage": [{"@id": "_:Nfa2df6c0b5794b5cba11256bcd44bc32"}], "http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/generationProcess": [{"@id": "_:N6e2fa9180e51404d9049bfeb7b4de987"}], "http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/source": [{"@id": "_:Na8aba3e15c3c4851b61f8cd895b3498a"}], "http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/status": [{"@id": "_:N9eb0e1971aef4526ae7a796fed9e76de"}]}, {"@id": "_:Na8aba3e15c3c4851b61f8cd895b3498a", "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs": [{"@id": "https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/organizations/wau"}]}, {"@id": "_:N9eb0e1971aef4526ae7a796fed9e76de", "@type": ["http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/Status"], "http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/code": [{"@value": "n"}]}, {"@id": "_:Ndf57dd936e8d4ff89d205139cf02e9d6", "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs": [{"@id": "https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/descriptionConventions/rda"}]}, {"@id": "_:Nfa2df6c0b5794b5cba11256bcd44bc32", "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs": [{"@id": "https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/languages/eng"}]}, {"@id": "_:Nb1af9b902ab54fd98fe3ae106cc3a9a7", "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs": [{"@id": "https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/menclvl/f"}]}, {"@id": "_:N6e2fa9180e51404d9049bfeb7b4de987", "@type": ["http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/GenerationProcess"], "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label": [{"@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime", "@value": "rml.py SNAPSHOT: 2021-04-01T14:12:05+00:00"}]}, {"@id": "_:Nb0a06659266c41648c570d3e78a80689", "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs": [{"@id": "https://api.sinopia.io/resource/e81fff3a-c7f7-4edc-affb-2130397410b1"}]}], "user": "mcm104", "group": "washington", "templateId": "WAU:RT:BF2:Work", "types": ["http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/Work"], "id": "45a10b05-abaa-459a-990a-a629db88fb00", "uri": "https://api.stage.sinopa.io/resource/45a10b05-abaa-459a-990a-a629db88fb00", "timestamp": "2021-04-01T14:22:11"}
